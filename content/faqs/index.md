### Payment Strategies

**Q: What payoff strategies does the app support?**

A: The app currently supports two proven debt payoff strategies for all users:
- The Snowball Method focuses on paying off your smallest debts first, regardless of interest rate. This approach helps build momentum and motivation as you quickly eliminate individual debts.
- The Avalanche Method prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first. This strategy typically saves you the most money in interest charges over time.

For subscribers, we also offer Cashflow Optimization, which creates a personalized repayment plan based on your unique income patterns and expenses.

We're continuously working to expand our debt payoff features to better serve our users' needs.

**Q: How does the app determine which debt payoff method is best for my situation?**

A: The app helps you explore different debt payoff strategies but lets you make the final decision about what works best for your situation. You can see how different strategies would affect your payoff timeline and total interest paid, helping you make an informed choice based on your financial goals and preferences. While we give you the information and calculations you need, you're in control of choosing the strategy that feels right for you.

**Q: Can I switch between different payment strategies after I've started my plan?**

A: Yes, you can switch between different payment strategies any time you want. Feel free to try different approaches and change your monthly contribution amount whenever it makes sense for you. You can review and adjust your strategy as often as you'd like - there's no limit on how many times you can make changes.

### Security & Privacy

**Q: Is my financial data secure?**

A: Your financial data stays private and secure. The app only sees what you choose to share. We protect your information in two ways: all data is stored in an encrypted database, and you can set up a PIN code to make sure only you can open the app.

**Q: Does the app store my banking credentials?**

A: We do not ask for or store any banking credentials (like usernames, passwords, or PINs). The app only works with the information that you choose to share with us. Your banking login details always stay with you and are never shared with or stored by our app.

**Q: Is my data backed up? Can I access it across multiple devices?**

A: This is currently not supported. We're working on adding these features in an upcoming version.
