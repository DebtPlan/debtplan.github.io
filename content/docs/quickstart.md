Welcome to DebtPlan! This app will help you make a plan to pay off your debt. Here's how to get started:

## Enter your Debts

The first step is to list each debt that you want to include in your plan. The place to do this is on the **Debt List** page. For each you'll add:

- The name of the debt (like "Honda Civic" or "Discover Card")
- How much you currently owe
- The interest rate
- The minimum monthly payment

## Choose a Payment Plan

On the **Payment Plan** page, enter an amount that you can put toward debt payments each month, then choose a payment strategy.

- Snowball - Clear some debts quickly by prioritizing debts with small balances
- Avalanche - Save money by prioritizing higher interest rate debts.

You can compare the results of various strategies. The Plan Summary will show your anticipated payoff date and total savings. Once you're ready click **Begin with this Strategy** at the bottom of the page to save this plan.

## Track Progress

Each month come back to the **Dashboard** to enter your updated balances. You'll be able to see your overall progress and amount paid off. On the **Debt List** page you can see the progress within each individual debt.
